# Proef

This dir contains some fake code files that serve no purpose whatsoever except for testing.
I simply don't want to damage any real code files (even with a backup routine in place)


# IMPORTANT NOTE!

It should go without saying, but as MKL_Update is designed to add or update license blocks, I had to add them to these source codes as well... Needless to say that since they are all tests, they don't have any meaning at all here....
And since these are all "Hello World" programs, I guess we can just consider them "public domain".
